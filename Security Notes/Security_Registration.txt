		6. Spring Security
	-> Create a User entity with id, name, email, password
	-> Make id as primary key and auto increment
	-> Create a Repository for it
	-> Create a Post request with and endpoint "/register" in controller
	-> Get the input from Request Body
	-> Pass it to Service

		PasswordEncoder pwdEncode() {
			return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
		}
